TheFlightSims takes the security responsibilities  of our software products and services seriously, including all open-source software and closed-source software

## Reporting Security Issues

You can report security issues on these platforms:

* [Discord]() (Direct Message is recommended)
* The repository security page (Prefered)
* [Email](mailto:theflightsims@gmail.com)

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

* Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting)

* Full paths of the source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue

* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)

* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue

* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue

* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)

* Impact of the case, including how an attacker might control the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

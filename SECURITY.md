# Security

TheFlightSims takes the security responsibilities  of our software products and services seriously, including all open-source software and closed-source software

## Reporting Security Issues

**Note:** You shouldn't report the security vulnerabilities on the Issue or the public place. Any attackers can use these vulnerabilities to exploit non-public data - which causes security vulnerability.

You can report security issues on these platforms:

* The repository security page (Preferred)
* [Email](mailto:welcome.tfs@outlook.com)

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

* Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting)
* Full paths of the source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Impact of the case, including how an attacker might control the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Preferred Languages

You can use all human-valid languages. However, you may consider using English (US) to prevent misunderstanding.
